# Android Capstone: Taskr

## Problem
Assigning tasks to people can be a tedious ordeal; both parties must agree on due dates, times and the task requirements. If there is a dispute, finding or remembering all the details of the task at hand becomes difficult and leads to incorrect completion of the task. It can also be difficult to find help on certain tasks you need accomplished, and individually asking people for help can be tedious and time intensive. Another problem faced when given multiple tasks is losing track of them. Currently, it is the receiver’s responsibility to remember his or her given tasks. If not written down, less prioritized tasks will inevitably be forgotten.

The Taskr app will help users to manage their responsibilities through an effective visual dashboard of the users’ requested tasks and tasks to be completed. Push notifications will help to keep users alert of upcoming tasks.
